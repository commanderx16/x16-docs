# Chapter 11: Working With CMDR-DOS

## CMDR-DOS

Commander-16 duplicates and extends the programming interface used by Commodore's line of disk drives. Aside from the LOAD, SAVE, OPEN commands, and their variants,
the DOS interface is accessed through the DOS command. 

Typing DOS by itself will query the disk drive and return the drive's status code:
`DOS`
`00, 0K, 00, 00`
`READY.`

If the last disk operation resulted in an error, the response code will include the error number and the erorr message. For example:
`62, FILE NOT FOUND,00,00`
