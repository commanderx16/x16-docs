## BASIC FMPLAY and PSGPLAY string macros

### Musical notes
* Synopsis: Play a musical note, optionally setting the length.
* Syntax: `<A-G>[<+/->][<length>][.]`

Example:
```BASIC
    FMPLAY 0,"A+2A4C.G-8."
```
On the YM2151 using channel 0, plays in the current octave an **A&#9839;** [half note<sup>?</sup>](# "minim") followed by an **A** [quarter note<sup>?</sup>](# "crotchet"), followed by **C** dotted quarter note, followed by **G&#9837;** dotted [eighth note<sup>?</sup>](# "quaver").

Lengths and dots after the note name or rest set the length just for the current note or rest.  To set the default length for subsequent notes and rests, use the `L` macro.


### Rests
* Synopsis: Wait for a period of silence equal to the length of a note, optionally setting the length.
* Syntax: `R[<length>][.]`

Example:
```BASIC
    PSGPLAY 0,"C4RDRE"
```
On the VERA PSG using voice 0, plays in the current octave a **C** quarter note, followed by silence of the same length, followed by a **D** of the same length, followed by silence of the same length, and finally an **E** of the same length.

The numeral `4` in `C4` set the length for the `C` itself and all the rests and notes that followed it.

### Note Length
* Synopsis: Set the default length for notes and rests that follow
* Syntax: `L[<length>][.]`

Example values:
* L4 = quarter note (crotchet)
* L16 = sixteenth note (semiquaver)
* L12 = 8th note triplets (quaver triplet)
* L4. = dotted quarter note (1.5x the length)
* L4.. = double-dotted quarter note (1.75x the length)

Example program:
```BASIC
    10 FMPLAY 0,"L4"
    20 FOR I=1 TO 2
    30 FMPLAY 0,"CDECL8"
    40 NEXT
```
On the YM2151 using channel 0, this program, when RUN, plays in the current octave the sequence **C** **D** **E** **C** first as quarter notes, then as eighth notes the second time around.

### Articulation
* Synopsis: Set the spacing between notes, from legato to extreme staccato
* Syntax: `S<0-7>`

`S0` indicates legato. For FMPLAY, this also means that notes after the first in a phrase don't implicitly retrigger. 

`S1` is the default value, which plays a note for 7/8 of the duration of the note, and releases the note for the remaining 1/8 of the note's duration.

You can think of `S` is, out of 8, how much space is put between the notes.

Example:
```BASIC
    FMPLAY 0,"L4S1CDES0CDES4CDE"
```
On the YM2151 using channel 0, plays in the current octave the sequence **C** **D** **E** three times, first with normal articulation, next with legato (notes all run together and without retriggering), and finally with a moderate staccato.


### Explicit retrigger
* Synopsis: on the YM2151, when using `S0` legato, retrigger on the next note.
* Syntax: `K`

Example:
```BASIC
    FMPLAY 0,"S0CDEKFGA"
```
On the YM2151 using channel 0, plays in the current octave the sequence **C** **D** **E** using legato, only triggering on the first note, then the sequence **F** **G** **A** the same way. The note **F** is triggered without needing to release the previous note early.


### Octave
* Synopsis: Explictly set the octave number for notes that follow
* Syntax: `O<0-7>`

Example:
```BASIC
    PSGPLAY 0,"O4AO2AO6CDE"
```
On the VERA PSG using voice 0, changes to octave 4 and plays **A** (440Hz), then switches to octave 2, and plays **A** (110Hz), then switches to octave 6 and plays the sequence **C** **D** **E**

### Octave Up
* Synopsis: Increases the octave by 1
* Syntax: `>`

If the octave would go above 7, this macro has no effect.

Example:
```BASIC
    PSGPLAY 0,"O4AB>C+DE"
```
On the VERA PSG using voice 0, changes to octave 4 and plays the first five notes of the **A major** scale by switching to octave 5 starting at the **C&#9839;**

### Octave Down
* Synopsis: Decreases the octave by 1
* Syntax: `<`

If the octave would go below 0, this macro has no effect.
Example:
```BASIC
    PSGPLAY 0,"O5GF+EDC<BAG"
```
On the VERA PSG using voice 0, changes to octave 5 and plays the **G major** scale from the top down by switching to octave 4 starting at the **B**

### Tempo
* Synopsis: Sets the BPM, the number of quarter notes per minute
* Syntax: `T<1-255>`

High tempo values and short notes tend to have inaccurate lengths due to quantization error. Delays within a string do keep track of fractional frames so the overall playback length should be relatively consistent.

Low tempo values that cause delays (lengths) to exceed 255 frames will also end up being inaccurate. For very long notes, it may be better to use legato to string several together.

Example:
```BASIC
    10 FMPLAY 0,"T120C4CGGAAGR"
    20 FMPLAY 0,"T180C4CGGAAGR"
```
On the YM2151 using channel 0, plays in the current octave the first 7 notes of *Twinkle Twinkle Little Star*, first at 120 beats per minute, then again 1.5 times as fast at 180 beats per minute.

### Volume
* Synopsis: Set the channel or voice volume
* Syntax: `V<0-63>`

This macro mirrors the `PSGVOL` and `FMVOL` BASIC commands for setting a channel or voice's volume. 0 is silent, 63 is maximum volume.

Example:
```BASIC
    FMPLAY 0,"V40ECV45ECV50ECV55ECV60ECV63EC"
```
On the YM2151 using channel 0, starting at a moderate volume, plays the sequence **E** **C**, repeatedly, increasing the volume steadily each time.


### Panning
* Synopsis: Sets the stereo output of a channel or voice to left, right, or both.
* Syntax: `P<1-3>`

1 = Left  
2 = Right  
3 = Both  

Example:
```BASIC
    10 FOR I=1 TO 4
    20 PSGPLAY 0,"P1CP2B+"
    30 NEXT I
    40 PSGPLAY 0,"P3C"
```
On the VERA PSG using voice 0, in the current octave, repeatedly plays a **C** out of the left speaker, then a **B&#9839;** (effectively a **C** one octave higher) out of the right speaker.  After 4 such loops, it plays a **C** out of both speakers.
