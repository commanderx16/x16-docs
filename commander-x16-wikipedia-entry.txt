The '''Commander X16''' (colloquially known as the '''X-16''') is an [[8-bit]] [[Retrocomputing]] [[home computer]]. It is the brainchild of '''The 8-Bit Guy''', who wanted an accessible and affordable 8-bit hobbyist platform. It is intended not only as an educational tool, but also to solve some of the issues of finding an 8-bit system to tinker with today; namely ever-increasing costs, auction site price gouging/sniping, and unreliability of 30-year old hardware. The X16 is made entirely with off-the-shelf modern parts, ensuring availability without reliability issues. It has a real 8-bit CPU rather than using emulation or an FPGA recreation of a processor. It is intended to be inexpensive enough to promote a critical mass of users, to create its own software ecosystem, yet be simple enough that a single person can understand the entire system.<ref>{{cite web|title=Commander X16 FAQ|url=https://www.commanderx16.com/forum/index.php?/about-faq/}}</ref>

==History==

===Origin===
In 2019, the popular YouTube program '''The 8-Bit Guy''' posted two videos entitled, where he discussed hardware considerations in building a modern 8-bit computer using off-the-shelf components. By the end of the second video, he had settled on a 6502-derived CPU, the [[Commodore]] [[KERNAL]], an architecture based loosely on the [[VIC-20]], and potential sound chips.<ref>{{cite web|title=My Dream Computer - Part 1|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayh0qebfD2g}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=My Dream Computer - Part 2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg-6Cjzzg8s}}</ref>

While the last [[Commodore]] 8-bit computers had [[BASIC]] 7.0, the '''X16''' defaulted to version 2.0, but grew the feature sets of both BASIC and the KERNAL.<ref>{{cite web|title=Commander X16 Programmer's Reference|url=https://github.com/commanderx16/x16-docs/blob/master/Commander%20X16%20Programmer's%20Reference%20Guide.md}}</ref>

===Applications===
The X16 is expected to ship with an augmented Commodore KERNAL, BASIC (with a DOS wedge, among other things), a machine language monitor, an assembly language editor, and more.<ref>{{cite web|title=Commander X16 FAQ|url=https://www.commanderx16.com/forum/index.php?/about-faq/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=My Dream Computer - Part 2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg-6Cjzzg8s}}</ref>

==Technical specifications==
The X16 ships with {{nowrap|40 KB}} [[Static random-access memory|RAM]]. {{nowrap|1 KB}} of this used by the system for I/O. The 512K [[read-only memory|ROM]] is split into banks of 16K; Bank 0 holds the Commodore KERNAL and BASIC. The X16 also ships with 512K "high" [[Static random-access memory|RAM]], which is split into banks of 8K.  High RAM is expandable up to 2MiB.

=== Ports and sockets ===
The X16 has four expansion slots with access to the CPU databus.  There is no datasette port, and device 0 is re-purposed for the SD card. The X16 also has an IEC connector, and can connect to a Commodore disk drive.  It also has two exposed SNES game controller connectors, with two internal pin headers that can support two more connectors. It accepts a PS/2 keyboard and mouse.<ref>{{cite web|title=Commander X16 FAQ|url=https://www.commanderx16.com/forum/index.php?/about-faq/}}</ref>

=== Graphics ===
The graphics capabilities of the X16 are provided by the single FGPA, code named "VERA". This chip has multiple output formats, at a fixed resolution of 640x480@60HZ. It supports two layers with various tile and bitmap modes, and up to 128 sprites. Its color palette is 256 colors, using a total range of 4096 colors.<ref>{{cite web|title=Commander X16 FAQ|url=https://www.commanderx16.com/forum/index.php?/about-faq/}}</ref>

=== Sound ===
Audio is not finalized; there are three separate sound generators being considered. For basic sound, the VERA chip itself has a programmable sound generator based loosely on the SID; the SAA1099 is also being looked at. For MIDI-like sound, the Yamaha YM2151 is being considered.<ref>{{cite web|title=Commander X16 FAQ|url=https://www.commanderx16.com/forum/index.php?/about-faq/}}</ref>
