# Chapter 10: Commander X16 Programmer's Reference Guide

## I/O Programming

There are two 65C22 "Versatile Interface Adapter" (VIA) I/O controllers in the system, VIA#1 at address $9F00 and VIA#2 at address $9F10. The IRQ out lines of VIA#1 is connected to the CPU's NMI line, while the IRQ out line of VIA#2 is connected to the CPU's IRQ line.

The-following tables describe the connections of the I/O pins:

**VIA#1**

| CA1 | _Unused_ |                                 |
| CA2 | _Unused_ |                                 |
| CB1 | IECSRQ   |                                 |
| CB2 | _Unused_ |                                 |

The KERNAL uses Timer 2 for timing transmissions on the Serial Bus.

**VIA#2**

The second VIA is completely unused by the system. All its 16 GPIOs and 4 handshake I/Os can be freely used.

### I2C Bus

The Commander X16 contains an I2C bus, which is implemented through two pins of VIA#1. The system management controller (SMC) and the real-time clock (RTC) are connected through this bus. The KERNAL APIs `i2c_read_byte` and `i2c_write_byte` allow talking to these devices.

#### System Management Controller

The system management controller (SMC) is device $42 on the I2C bus. It controls the power and activity LEDs, and can be used to power down the system or inject RESET and NMI signals.

| Register | Value    | Description             |
|----------|----------|-------------------------|
| $01      | $00      | Power off               |
| $01      | $01      | Hard reboot             |
| $02      | $00      | Inject RESET            |
| $03      | $00      | Inject NMI              |
| $04      | $00..$FF | Power LED brightness    |
| $05      | $00..$FF | Activity LED brightness |

#### Real-Time-Clock

The Commander X16 contains a battery-backed Microchip MCP7940N real-time-clock (RTC) chip as device $6F. It provide a real-time clock/calendar, two alarms and 64 bytes of RAM.
